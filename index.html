        Juan Antonio Giménez López was an argentine comic book artist and author born on the 26th of november of 1943,
        in Mendoza, Argentina.He was known for his very detailed machine-like and sci-fi designs. Some of his most
        recognized works include
        the comic series Metabarons co-developed with Alejandro Jodorowsky and his design of the "Harry Canyon" segment
        of the 1980 film Heavy Metal.
        In his childhood he was fascinated by comics and movies, this would take him to draw and try to replicate his
        favourite scenes and panels. These would be the foundations over which he built his
        skills as a drawer and a storyteller.

          Later in his life Giménez graduated as an industrial designer and spent his early career working in publicity
          as a graphic designer.
          In the seventies, he left Argentina to move to Europe and debuted in the italian magazines Lancio Story and
          Skorpio, then he settled in spain permanently.
          Amongst the many prizes and recognitions he won during his career are the "Yellow Kid" granted by the
          international comic hall of Lucca in 1990 and the Blue D'Or in France 1994. Regrettably the master passed away
          the 2nd of April 2020 (aged 76) in Mendoza, Argentina due to covid-19 infection.
          His legacy lives on his works and has always been an will continue to be an inspiration for younger artists
          that dare to dream and reach for their goals.
